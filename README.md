## What's new?
### v2.5.5
- Added a picture of a satisfying cat.
- You don't need to worry about getting a proxy list anymore as we already implemented a proxy list scraper in the tool (thanks to andress134 for the suggestion).
- We completely removed the HTTP statistics as we cannot accurately collect data from it.
- Added custom header parameters.
- Live display with curses.
