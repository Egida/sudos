# SuDOS

SuDOS is a proxy-based DDOS tool (pseudo-botnet) written in Python with live statistics display program.

Read the official documentation here: https://github.com/lilmond/sudos/blob/main/docs/manual.md

This tool is on experimental version because we're thinking of every possible way to make this tool run and work at it's best, so expect bugs to occur!
